/*
Optimized Query to analyze services for each month of 2021 with cost greater than 600:

This SQL query analyzes services provided in each month of 2021 where the service cost is greater than 600.
It calculates the total number of such services, their total cost, the maximum and minimum cost,
and the percentage of printed and non-printed invoices for each month.
The query has been optimized by adding indexes and using hash join and parallel execution hints to improve performance.

Optimization Details:
- Index on tbl_SERVICE.col_datetime: Improves the filtering performance by the date.
- Index on tbl_SERVICE.col_payment_id: Improves the join performance between tbl_SERVICE and tbl_PAYMENT.
- The USE_HASH hint indicates the use of hash join, which is efficient for large datasets without good indexes for nested loops.

Data Analysis:
- The query joins the tbl_SERVICE and tbl_PAYMENT tables.
- Filters services for the year 2021 and where the service cost is greater than 600.
- Groups the results by month and calculates COUNT, SUM, MAX, MIN, and percentage of printed and non-printed invoices.

Query Components:
- Month (service_month): The month of the service in the format 'YYYY-MM'.
- Service count (total_services): The total number of services with cost greater than 600.
- Total cost (total_cost): The total cost of services with cost greater than 600.
- Maximum cost (max_cost): The maximum cost of services with cost greater than 600.
- Minimum cost (min_cost): The minimum cost of services with cost greater than 600.
- Printed invoice percentage (printed_invoice_percentage): The percentage of services with printed invoices.
- Non-printed invoice percentage (non_printed_invoice_percentage): The percentage of services without printed invoices.

Sorting:
- The results are sorted by service month.
